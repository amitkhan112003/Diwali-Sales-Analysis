Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Leveraged Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to:
Visualize customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, occupation, state)
Analyze purchasing behavior and spending patterns
Identify sales distribution across product categories and regions

Customer Segmentation:

Identified potential customer segments by analyzing attributes like state, occupation, gender, and age group. This helps in targeted marketing and enhancing customer experience.

Sales Improvement Strategies:

Determined top-selling product categories and products, providing insights for inventory planning and demand forecasting. These findings can help optimize stock levels and promotional efforts.

## Key Insights

Demographics:

The majority of buyers are females, who also exhibit higher purchasing power compared to males.

The 26-35 age group is the most active, contributing nearly 40% of total sales, especially among married women.

Most buyers are married and work in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.

Regional Trends:

Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are the top states in terms of both order volume and sales amount.

These regions present significant opportunities for targeted marketing and inventory optimization.

Product Preferences:

Food, Clothing, and Electronics are the most popular product categories.

Products with IDs P00265242 and P00110942 are among the top sellers
## Conclusion

Married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, are most likely to purchase products from Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

Targeted marketing and inventory planning for these segments can significantly improve sales and customer satisfaction.

There is potential to further engage less active segments, such as the 55+ age group, through tailored campaigns and product offerings.
